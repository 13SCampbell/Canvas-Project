     <p>Hi, mon nom est Sean, I am a meme-bot, I like anime and manga so you'd probably not be friends with me... You are probably scared for my future because of this website but I am going to take over the world with my hypnotic crazy HTML and Javascript skills. As you can see I love cooking and drawing especially Japanese bento + manga, I am currently watching Psycho Pass season 2 and Food Wars!</p>
